# Vim Config

## What's in it ?
I made this .vimrc because the basics keybinds of vim aren't great for AZERTY Keyboards
The new mouvements are `jklm` instead of `hjkl`

But I made other changes (yep not that pure vim right there)

### List (not everything) of changes
- tabstop, shiftwidth, softtapstop -> 4
- tab symbol -> | 
- no backup, undodir (don't forget to create the dir to make it working)
- noexpandtab
- relative numbers
- scrolloff -> 8
- encoding -> utf-8
- `jk` to quit insert mode
- `Ã¹` to go to the start of the line in visual and normal mode

Don't forget to watch the whole config to adapt it to your style.

### Plugins
My config is very light, so there is not big plugins. I have emmet, vcm, airline, 3 color-schemes, vim-svelte, vim-js, and airline themes
I use vim-plug, to install theses. So if you want to test my plugins, install vim-plug first.
None of my plugins are necessary, you can just use whatever you want. (don't forget to change the colorscheme)

### Conclusion
This is a lightweight config for vim to help AZERTY users. Everything should work fine.
Bye !
